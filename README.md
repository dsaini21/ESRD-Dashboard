# ESRD-Dashboard

Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard that I developed to analyze end-stage renal disease (ESRD) data. Using synthetic data from Synthea, I built interactive visuals that provide insights into patient demographics and lab goal achievement rates.

The primary goals of this dashboard are:

To track the ESRD patient census, broken down by age and race.
To monitor monthly lab targets for various health indicators, highlighting patient progress toward achieving their lab goals.

Data Overview
Dataset Source: Synthetic data generated using Synthea, with over 6 million records initially stored in SQL.
Data Transformation: Data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed to focus on critical metrics for ESRD, including patient demographics and key lab values.
Key Metrics:
Patient count by age, race, and region
Monthly percentage of time each patient met their lab targets for sodium, albumin, BUN, and calcium

Skills Demonstrated
Data Visualization: Created engaging and interactive visualizations using Power BI.
Data Analytics: Conducted in-depth analysis of healthcare data, focusing on ESRD-specific metrics.
Healthcare Knowledge: Applied understanding of lab values and their importance in managing ESRD patients.
SQL & Data Management: Extracted, transformed, and managed a large dataset for use in Power BI.
