# ESRD-Dashboard

<b>Overview:</b> <br>
This project is a Power BI dashboard that I developed to analyze end-stage renal disease (ESRD) data. Using synthetic data from Synthea, I built interactive visuals that provide insights into patient demographics and lab goal achievement rates.

The primary goals of this dashboard are:

- To track the ESRD patient census, broken down by age and race.<br>
- To monitor monthly lab targets for various health indicators, highlighting patient progress toward achieving their lab goals.<br>

<b>Data Overview:</b> <br>
- Dataset Source: Synthetic data generated using Synthea, with over 6 million records initially stored in SQL.<br>
- Data Transformation: Data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed to focus on critical metrics for ESRD, including patient demographics and key lab values.<br>

<b> Key Metrics:</b> <br>
  - Patient count by age, race, and region<br>
  - Monthly percentage of time each patient met their lab targets for sodium, albumin, BUN, and calcium<br>

<b>Skills Demonstrated</b> <br>
- Data Visualization: Created engaging and interactive visualizations using Power BI.<br>
- Data Analytics: Conducted in-depth analysis of healthcare data, focusing on ESRD-specific metrics.<br>
- Healthcare Knowledge: Applied understanding of lab values and their importance in managing ESRD patients.<br>
- SQL & Data Management: Extracted, transformed, and managed a large dataset for use in Power BI.<br>
